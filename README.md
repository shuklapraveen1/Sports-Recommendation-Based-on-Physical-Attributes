# 🏅 Sports Recommendation Based on Physical Attributes

This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable sport for an individual based on 13 physical attributes. The model predicts one of the following five sports: **Football**, **Cricket**, **Badminton**, **Tennis**, or **Gymnastics**.

## 📌 Project Goal

To build a predictive model that:
- Takes 13 physical characteristics as input.
- Outputs the most suitable sport from a predefined list.
- Helps in talent identification and sport recommendation.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Multiple machine learning models tested (e.g., Random Forest, KNN, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report
- Final model export for deployment
- User input interface for sport prediction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📂 File Structure

```
.
├── sports.ipynb          # Main notebook with code, analysis, and results
├── README.md             # Project overview and instructions
```

## 🧠 Model Performance

- Final model: `RandomForestClassifier` (or whichever performed best)
- Accuracy: *e.g.*, 94%
- Detailed classification report included in the notebook

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shuklapraveen1/Sports-Recommendation-Based-on-Physical-Attributes.git
    cd Sports-Recommendation-Based-on-Physical-Attributes
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
